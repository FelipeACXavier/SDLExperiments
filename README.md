# SDLExperiments

A few experiments using SDL2 and the linalg library.

## [Wave generation](wave_generation/).

Test linalg libary by creating a complex wave shape comprised of n waves of random phase and frequency.

It is also possible to create waves using the corresponding [fourier series](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fourier_series).

## [Boids](boids/)

[Boid](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Boids) behaviour.

## [Web](web/)

Tests with creation of web assembly projects using SDL and emscripten.
